Image Generation with Pre-trained Model

Overview

This repository contains code and instructions for generating images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The model can be used to generate high-quality images based on specific inputs, such as text prompts or noise vectors.

Features

Utilize a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., GANs, VAEs, or Diffusion Models)

Generate high-resolution images

Fine-tune the model for specific datasets

Easily integrate with various input types

Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-generation.git
cd image-generation
Usage

1. Load the Pre-trained Model

Modify model_loader.py to specify the pre-trained model you want to use. Example:import torch
from torchvision import models

model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
model.eval()
2. Generate Images

Run the script to generate images:python generate.py --input "Your prompt or noise vector"import torch
from model import PretrainedGAN

gan = PretrainedGAN()
noise = torch.randn(1, 100)
image = gan.generate(noise)
image.show()
3. Customization

Modify config.py to adjust model parameters.

Use different pre-trained models by updating model_loader.py.

Fine-tune on a custom dataset by following train.py.

Training (Optional)
python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 50
